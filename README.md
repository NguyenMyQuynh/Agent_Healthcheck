# Central management in Fleet

Fleet provides a web-based UI in Kibana for centrally managing Elastic Agents and their policies.

You can see the state of all your Elastic Agents in Fleet. On the Agents page, you can see which agents are healthy or unhealthy, and the last time they checked in. You can also see the version of the Elastic Agent binary and policy.
